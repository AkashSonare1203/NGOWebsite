# NGOWebsite
I participated in a hackathon <i>'Code For Change'</i> wherein we had to build a website for <i>'Human Team Foundation'</i> NGO. 
Here I added some features to the website like sticky navigation bar, on click scroll and also on the server side I created a database using <b>MySQL</b> to store the data of the viewers those who were willing to support the NGO.
On the user interface i used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</b> framework and <b>Javascript</b>.
